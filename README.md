This is a simple Armor optimizer for the Pathfinder RPG. The armors with the highest armor bonuses should be taken by
classes that don't care about a high dex bonus or armor check penalties (your average fighter or paladin). The armors
 with the highest armor ratings should be taken by classes that need the best of both worlds (high dex with good armor
 bonus). Lastly the armors with the highest arcane ratings should be taken by arcane spell users, as these are the
 armors with the highest armor and dex bonus, but the lowest spell failure chance.
